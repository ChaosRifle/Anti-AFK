# Anti-AFK

This script requires AutoHotKey to be installed.

Default keybinding is F8 to toggle the script but can be changed on line 64, where it says "F8::"

You can reboot the script with Ctrl+numpad 0

The script will prompt you for what type of AFK avoidance you would like. Supported inputs are: jumping or walking forwards and backwards with: W/S, E/D and arrow keys (sorry dvorak)

I got tired of being kicked from multiplayer lobbies in games like SC, where you would be idle for ten+ minutes for travel time, go grab dinner, return to your friend still not there yet, and you on the menu - only to spend twenty more minutes trying to get back in the same lobby as your friend. I got tired of AFK timers that are shorter than the travel time in the game.

Please use this responsibly, this is meant for you to be able to eat a quick meal and not be punished for it.
